doorOS Third Version, this time without an external API again (like the first one)

Main Goals:
- Multi-Language support
- kind-of Multitasking (my idea: pausing and resuming with the coroutine API)
- easy installation of programs
- additional program to make a project/program and compile it to a installer when finished
- try to support programs like Firewolf and Quest.


When downloading:
Please move all files into /doorOS/....
It won't work else.
